#Team members
Preetham Myathari, Max Schumacher, Shashank Valayaputtur, Worifung Achu, Kyndra Wynne
## Overview

This project was developed as part of the final course project, spanning the last ~8 weeks of the course. Working in a self-selected group of 3-5 members, we aimed to showcase technical proficiency in web and D3 programming while effectively communicating data insights through visualization design concepts and theory discussed in course lectures

#Key Dataset:

World Happiness Report (2005â€“2021): This dataset includes happiness scores for countries, calculated based on factors like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Visualization Design and Development:

All visualizations were implemented using D3.js for powerful customization and interactivity:

Choropleth Map (Worifung Achu, wachu1): Displayed geographic patterns in happiness scores, with hover interactivity showing detailed metrics like country names and ladder scores.

Heatmap (Kyndra Wynne, knwynne): Illustrated relationships between happiness factors, enabling quick identification of clusters and correlations via intuitive color gradients.

Radial Chart and Treemap Combination (Shashank Valayaputtur, svalayap): Highlighted the relative contributions of happiness determinants, such as freedom, income, and social support, in specific regions.
